# Template System Architecture Analysis Plan

## Task: Comprehensive analysis of React/TypeScript project template system

### Analysis Goals:
- [ ] Understand current project structure and key files
- [ ] Identify main canvas/editor implementation 
- [ ] Analyze Firebase integration and data models
- [ ] Find existing template loading/rendering logic
- [ ] Search for broken imports or missing files
- [ ] Identify incomplete implementations
- [ ] Understand template workflow from loading to editing
- [ ] Document current implementation status

### Analysis Steps:
1. [ ] **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Identify template-related components and files
   - Map out main canvas/editor architecture
   - Document Firebase integration points
   - Catalog data models and interfaces

2. [ ] **Template System Deep Dive**
   - Analyze template loading from Firebase
   - Understand template display in UI
   - Map template selection and editing flow
   - Document canvas editor integration

3. [ ] **Issue Identification**
   - Find broken imports or missing components
   - Identify incomplete implementations
   - Locate TODO comments and error handling gaps
   - Check for hardcoded URLs or missing configurations

4. [ ] **Workflow Documentation**
   - Document complete template flow
   - Identify integration points
   - Map user interaction patterns
   - Note performance considerations

5. [ ] **Report Generation**
   - Create comprehensive analysis report
   - Document findings with file paths and code snippets
   - Provide implementation status overview
   - List major issues and recommendations

### Success Criteria:
- Complete understanding of template system architecture
- Clear documentation of current implementation status
- Identification of all major issues and gaps
- Actionable recommendations for improvements
